# LenoxBot

**Welcome on the Documentation of LenoxBot!**

LenoxBot was created on **5th September 2017**. Since then we have released over **2500** updates and spent over **1000** hours making the bot more user-friendly than any other bot!

Our goal was and still is, to provide every botuser an all-in bot so he doesn't have to invite 10 other bots for all the features that he wants to have on his discord server.

We released our own [**website** ](https://lenoxbot.com)including the dashboard in **May 2018** and it offers you a place where you can set up almost all settings of the bot via your browser!

If you are a **new** user of LenoxBot, I would advise you to read on 

{% page-ref page="getting-started.md" %}

so that you will **quickly** become familiar with LenoxBot!
